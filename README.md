I tried to keep my time under 2 hours. By the time, I reached this stage it was around 2.20 mins and hence, I stopped and published my project. More work needs to be done.
1. Need to add more unit tests. There are number of scenarios which aren't covered.
	1. Test GameOverException.
	2. Get score at the middle of the game.
	3. Test the score when 10th frame together is 10 pins.
	4. Few more cases could be added as while testing this, more issues would be found.
2. Need a driver program from the console could be made to actually enter the details of pins. I didn't do it for now, because adding everytime running the console was taking time to test.
3. The logic could be polished.
4. Comments need to be added.

More could be there.
